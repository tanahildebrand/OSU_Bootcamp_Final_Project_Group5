# OSU Data Bootcamp Final Project (Group 5)

## Topic
The World Happiness Report uses global survey data to report how people evaluate their own lives in more than 150 countries worldwide. It measures "happiness" based on six criteria: income, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on in times of trouble (family size), generosity, freedom and trust, with the latter measured by the absence of corruption in business and government. With this review, we want to determine if a country's dietary habits predict their World Happiness Score.
